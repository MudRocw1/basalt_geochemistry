# basalt_geochemistry
This jupyter notebook includes python codes for manuscript 'A machine learning approach to discern detachment of the subducting slab in an ancient subduction zone using basalt trace elemental data'. The main parts are:
- Data preprocessing
- Machine learning model training and validation
- SHAP, machine learning model explainability
- Make prediction by using the trained machine learning model
